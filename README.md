## Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate ‚ÄúBusiness and Data Intelligence‚Äù to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

### Task:

You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following tasks-

- Create the metrics according to the metric list.

- Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.

- Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

## üìä Key Insights from the Analysis
- ADR (Average Daily Rate) Stability:
 
     ADR remains fairly consistent across weekdays and weekends. This indicates a missed opportunity to implement dynamic pricing strategies to optimize revenue during peak demand periods.

- Hotel Performance Extremes:

  - Highest Revenue: AtliQ Exotica, Mumbai ‚Äì ‚Çπ118M

  - Lowest Revenue: AtliQ Grands, Delhi ‚Äì ‚Çπ36M

- Occupancy Leader:

     AtliQ Palace (Delhi) recorded the highest occupancy rate at 66.4%, showcasing strong demand and/or efficient room utilization.

- Customer Ratings Impact:

  - Hotels with higher customer ratings consistently demonstrate superior Daily Booking Revenue per Night (DBRN) and Daily Utilized Room Nights (DURN).

  - Example: AtliQ Exotica (Mumbai) significantly outperforms AtliQ Seasons (Mumbai) on both metrics.

- RevPAR and Ratings Correlation:
     Properties with lower rating points tend to have RevPAR values that are up to 30% lower than the portfolio average, highlighting the importance of customer satisfaction.

- Performance Anomaly:
     AtliQ City (Hyderabad) enjoys high customer ratings but has below-par RevPAR, signaling the need for better pricing optimization or occupancy enhancement efforts.
